# Things to consider:
1. Unit testing
2. Stopping execution after closing console
3. Adding information about state and province of the displayed city
4. Displaying other parameters
5. Adding alarams to map with ids, so that only when new alarm arrives, a system warning is displayed
6. Binaries included in bin.

If you have any doubts concerning my approach please let me know, I was speeding a bit.
I can build something more. :)
